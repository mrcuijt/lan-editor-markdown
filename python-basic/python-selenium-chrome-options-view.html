These keys are available in addition to keys provided by the most recent call to TrustTokenKeyCommitments::Set. For issuers with keys provided through both the command line and TrustTokenKeyCommitments::Set, the keys provided through the command line take precedence. This is because someone testing manually might want to pass additional keys via the command line to a real Chrome release with the component updater enabled, and it would be surprising if the manually-passed keys were overwritten some time after startup when the component updater runs. </td></tr>

This is used in tast test to explicitly turn on guest ureadahead (see |kArcDisableUreadahead|). generate - used during Android Uprev data collector to pre-generate pack file and upload to Google Cloud as build artifact for CrOS build image. disabled - used for test purpose to disable ureadahead during ARCVM boot. note, |kArcDisableUreadahead| also disables both, guest and host parts of ureadahead. </td></tr>

Suppressing dialogs, prompts, and bubbles is important as this switch is used by automation (including performance benchmarks) where it's important only a browser window is shown.

The touch slop distance is the maximum distance from the starting point of a touch sequence that a gesture can travel before it can no longer be considered a tap. Scroll gestures can only begin after this distance has been travelled. The switch value is a floating point number that is interpreted as a distance in pixels. </td></tr>
<tr><td>--touchscreen-usable-while-screen-off</td><td>Chromebases' touchscreens can be used to wake from suspend, unlike the touchscreens on other Chrome OS devices. If set, the touchscreen is kept enabled while the screen is off so that it can be used to turn the screen back on after it has been turned off for inactivity but before the system has suspended. </td></tr>
<tr><td>--touch_view</td><td>No description </td></tr>
<tr><td>--tpm-is-dynamic</td><td>Enables TPM selection in runtime. </td></tr>
<tr><td>--trace-config-file</td><td>Causes TRACE_EVENT flags to be recorded from startup. This flag will be ignored if --trace-startup or --trace-shutdown is provided. </td></tr>
<tr><td>--trace-smb-size</td><td>Configures the size of the shared memory buffer used for tracing. Value is provided in kB. Defaults to 4096. Should be a multiple of the SMB page size (currently 32kB on Desktop or 4kB on Android). </td></tr>
<tr><td>--trace-startup</td><td>Causes TRACE_EVENT flags to be recorded from startup. Optionally, can specify the specific trace categories to include (e.g. --trace-startup=base,net) otherwise, all events are recorded. Setting this flag results in the first call to BeginTracing() to receive all trace events since startup. Historically, --trace-startup was used for browser startup profiling and --enable-tracing was used for browsertest tracing. Now they are share the same implementation, but both are still supported to avoid disrupting existing workflows. The only difference between them is the default duration (5 seconds for trace-startup, unlimited for enable-tracing). If both are specified, 'trace-startup' takes precedence. In Chrome, you may find --trace-startup-file and --trace-startup-duration to control the auto-saving of the trace (not supported in the base-only TraceLog component). </td></tr>
<tr><td>--trace-startup-duration</td><td>Sets the time in seconds until startup tracing ends. If omitted: - if --trace-startup is specified, a default of 5 seconds is used. - if --enable-tracing is specified, tracing lasts until the browser is closed. Has no effect otherwise. </td></tr>
<tr><td>--trace-startup-file</td><td>If supplied, sets the file which startup tracing will be stored into, if omitted the default will be used "chrometrace.log" in the current directory. Has no effect unless --trace-startup is also supplied. Example: --trace-startup --trace-startup-file=/tmp/trace_event.log As a special case, can be set to 'none' - this disables automatically saving the result to a file and the first manually recorded trace will then receive all events since startup. </td></tr>
<tr><td>--trace-startup-format</td><td>Sets the output format for the trace, valid values are "json" and "proto". If not set, the current default is "proto". "proto", unlike json, supports writing the trace into the output file incrementally and is more likely to retain more data if the browser process unexpectedly terminates. Ignored if "trace-startup-owner" is not "controller". </td></tr>
<tr><td>--trace-startup-owner</td><td>Specifies the coordinator of the startup tracing session. If the legacy tracing backend is used instead of perfetto, providing this flag is not necessary. Valid values: 'controller', 'devtools', or 'system'. Defaults to 'controller'. If 'controller' is specified, the session is controlled and stopped via the TracingController (e.g. to implement the timeout). If 'devtools' is specified, the startup tracing session will be owned by DevTools and thus can be controlled (i.e. stopped) via the DevTools Tracing domain on the first session connected to the browser endpoint. If 'system' is specified, the system Perfetto service should already be tracing on a supported platform (currently only Android). Session is stopped through the normal methods for stopping system traces. </td></tr>
<tr><td>--trace-startup-record-mode</td><td>If supplied, sets the tracing record mode and options; otherwise, the default "record-until-full" mode will be used. </td></tr>
<tr><td>--trace-to-console</td><td>Sends a pretty-printed version of tracing info to the console. </td></tr>
